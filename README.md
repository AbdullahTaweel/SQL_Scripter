# SQL_Scripter
## This repository showcases the complex, multi-entity SQL database design that underpinned a self-initiated project for a web-based screenplay platform.
The detailed schema, covering entities from projects, scenes, and dialogues, etc. to user management, demonstrates advanced proficiency in relational database modeling and normalization.
View the scripter_create.sql file for in depth dive.

This work highlights my autonomous, self-motivated approach to technical development and my ability to independently design scalable, user-centric data models that drive powerful, productivity-enhancing applications.

### The complete Database for the entire platform including the text editor and the social media space, and the users management system
